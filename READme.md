# Python/Sympy Jupyter notebook (JN) templates for labs in the Reference  

## Motivation
Educational: Provide a constructive and a gently guided way to use Python for solving multistep and often nonstandard mathematical problems from the Reference. Minimal computer literacy and a familiarity with very basic Python functions are sufficient.

## Quick Start
The project templates use the sympy, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. Each JN template contains just a few blank command lines that the user has to fill in before running it. The templates also include numerous comments for this task. For instructors teaching the course based on the book, complete versions of these JNs can be provided by request. The user can run any of the JNs using a local environment (for example, part of the freely available Anaconda installation) or in the cloud (on Google Colab or CoCalc).
