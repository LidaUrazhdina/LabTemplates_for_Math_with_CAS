        "Any Jupyter Notebook (JN) is made of \"text\" (Markdown) and \"code\" cells. Code cells must be executed to see the result of the program. To run a cell, select it and press Shift + Enter. Pressing Shift + Enter multiple times will execute consecutive blocks of code one after another, while skipping text cells (executing them does nothing). It is important to run the code cells in the order they appear in the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "A complete version of this JN is available by request to instructors using the book \"Exploring mathematics with CAS assistance\" for teaching. This version has blank or partially blank code lines that are supposed to be completed by the user before running the code.\n",

        "- a short comment placed on a code line typically states what the result of implementation of the encoded operation is\n",

Without loss of generality it is assumed  that $l_0 < l_1 < l_2.$ The total length of the assembly $L,$ an integer, is significantly larger than the length of any segment. The price of a segment of length $j$ is $p_j.$ Make a function that takes the total assembly length $L$, list of the segment lengths $T=[l_0,l_1,l_2],$ and list of the segment prices $P=[p_0,p_1,p_2]$ and returns the number of segments of each type needed to construct the assembly at minimum cost. The function should also return the minimum cost.\n",
